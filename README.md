# pandas-challenge
Using pandas in python to quickly analyze thousands of rows and gather meaningful results from the data
In this repo pandas is used to analyze data for a made up video game "Heroes of Pymoli". Like many video games in real life, "Heroes of Pymoli is free to play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items to enhance the game experience. That being said the jupyterlab code in this repo breaks down the game's purchasing data to different tables, so that meaningful insights and conclusions can be made about the game's purchasing history

## System Requirements
In this repo you will need to be able to use: 
- CSV Files 
- Python3
- Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas (library in python)

## Pseudocode
1. Read in CSV file 
2. Get count of how many players play game
3. Generate summary table of items in the game that can be purchased
4. Find % of players that are Male, Female, and Other / Non-Disclosed
5. Find total amount spend by Gender and average purchase per player by Gender
6. Find the % of players by Age Group
7. Find total amount spend by Age Group and average purchase per player by Age Group
8. Find the players that spend the most money
9. Find the items that were purchased the most and generated the most money
